If you have multiple projects (e.g. multiple websites, apps) that don't share content then those are best managed via separate spaces. If you have multiple projects that do share content then you'd want to manage those projects via the same space. You can choose different subscriptions for different spaces based on your needs. Learn more about spaces here.\n\nWhat is a visual view and how is it measured?\n\nVisual views (aka Builder pageviews) are tracked by a pixel we add to visual content created in in the Visual Editor (using a visual page model or visual section model) and rendered by a customer's site or app. Content from Data models do not count as part of your page views, and are effectively free in this regard. For Data models, Builder only uses bandwidth metering. Learn more\n\nDo you charge for content types and entries?\n\nNo! We do not want arbitrary limits to impact architectural decisions.Therefore, we offer unlimited content models, content entries, and API requests for all accounts.\n\nDo you offer a free trial?\n\nYes, we want everyone to experience the full power of Builder so every new space has a 30-day free trial for both our Basic and Growth plans. Each trial allows you to access the respective plan's features. Note that the 30-day trial is universal, so it won't add up if you try both plans. When the trial ends, you'll be prompted to choose the plan that best fits your needs.\n\nWhat if I hit my context window limit?\n\nYou will either need to upgrade your plan or reduce the size of the design file for which you're generating quality code. For example, instead of generating quality code for a whole page, limit it to just a section of a page at at time.\n\nWhat if I need to add more users?\n\nNo problem! Both our Basic and Growth plans come with one seat included. If you need additional user seats, you can purchase them directly on the platform. For the Basic plan, each additional seat is $24/month ($19/month if billed annually). On the Growth plan, extra seats are priced at $49/month ($39/month if billed annually).\n\nShould you need more than the allowed seats under these plans, an Enterprise solution might be best. Feel free to contact sales@builder.io for more details.\n\nWhat if I need to add more visual views?\n\nBoth our Basic and Growth plans start with 100k monthly visual views. If you need more, you can purchase additional visual views directly in the platform. The cost for each extra set of views is $6/month (or $5/month if paid annually) on the Basic plan and $8/month (or $6/month if paid annually) on the Growth plan. Typically, if your needs exceed a large number of visual views, an Enterprise plan might be the best fit. For inquiries about higher tiers or custom requirements, please reach out to sales@builder.io.\n\nWhat if I need more bandwidth?\n\nThere is a fair use limit on bandwidth based on your plan's visual views. For example, all paid plans come with 100k monthly visual views, which includes a fair use limit of 100 GB of bandwidth. For every 10k monthly visual views you add to your plan, your fair use limit increases by an additional 10 GB of bandwidth.\n\nBandwidth is the measure of data that Builder delivers on your site. Bandwidth is consumed when a web page loads assets, files, and content that you have stored in Builder. Read more about how you can keep up with your data usage.\n\nWhat if I'm using a static site generator (e.g. Next.js, Gatsby)?\n\nThat's great! Builder supports any static site generator. Note: our pricing applies to any type of integration whether you're fully caching the content on your end, self-hosting the content, or building server-side rendered / static sites with us.\n\nNot sure which plan is right for you?\nLet's chat\n\nGet the latest from Builder.io\n\nDev Drop Newsletter\n\nNews, tips, and tricks from Builder, for frontend developers.\n\n\nProduct Newsletter\n\nLatest features and updates on the Builder.io platform\n\nBy submitting, you agree to our Privacy Policy\n\nPRODUCT\n\nVisual Copilot\n\nVisual CMS\n\nIntegrations\n\nWhat's New\n\nCOMPANY\n\nAbout\n\nCareers\n\nDEVELOPERS\n\nDocumentation\n\nDevtools\n\nBuilder Blueprints\n\nOPEN SOURCE\n\nBuilder\n\nMitosis\n\nQwik\n\nPartytown\n\nSOLUTIONS\n\nHeadless Commerce\n\nMarketing Sites\n\nLanding Pages\n\nMobile Apps\n\nMulti-brand\n\nHeadless CMS\n\nPOPULAR GUIDES\n\nFrom Design to Code Ebook\n\nComposable Commerce Ebook\n\nHeadless CMS Guide\n\nHeadless Commerce Guide\n\nComposable DXP Guide\n\nDesign to Code\n\nRESOURCES\n\nBlog\n\nKnowledge Base\n\nCommunity Forum\n\nPartners\n\nPerformance Insights\n\nTemplates\n\nSuccess Stories\n\nShowcase\n\nResource Center\n\nBest of Web\n\nPage Builder\n\n>\n\nFRAMEWORKS\n\nReact\n\nNext.js\n\nQwik\n\nGatsby\n\nAngular\n\nVue\n\nSvelte\n\nRemix\n\nNuxt\n\nHydrogen\n\n© 2024 Builder.io, Inc.\n\nSecurity\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nSaaS Terms\n\nSecurity & Compliance\n\nCookie Preferences"
